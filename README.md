# E-FOOD-ORDERING SYSTEM
E-Food ordering system
This is my final project of the first year at ALX Software Engineering. The Goal of this project is to create an online food ordering system.



# What is Online Food Ordering System?
Online Food Ordering System is a website created specifically for the food delivery industry.
This Django and Python Framework-based online meal ordering system has an admin side and a customer side where the admin may handle sales, goods, categories, and food orders. The Admin is an integral part of the system’s management.

The administrator can easily manage meal orders here. The system displays the available dishes, along with their name, photo, category, price, the user must enter the amount and customer’s name. The customer can place an order online and see her or his orders in the shopping basket.
# Features of Online Food Ordering System using Django in admin side:
Dashboard — From the admin dashboard, you will have access to all of the system’s core functions. Orders, items, users, and categories are examples of cart items.
Admin Access to Item Management Information System — The admin has access to the item management information system. He has the ability to add, amend, and delete items.
Manage Orders — As one of the admin’s primary tasks, the admin can reject or accept orders from clients on a case-by-case basis.
Manage Categories — When it comes to categories, the admin has the ability to manage the category module. Best-selling foods, spicy foods, and new foods are examples of categories utilized in this approach.
Manage Users — The account of a user can be managed by the administrator. The system administrator has the ability to add, update, and delete users.
Secure Login and Logout — One of the system’s security features is the secure login and logout system, which is enabled by default.
# Features of Online Food Ordering System using Django in frontend side:
Home Page — From the home page, you can see a list of available foods, login, logout, and so on.
Viewing Products — The customer can view all of the foods, their prices, and descriptions on the frontend by default.
Checkout Order — The customer can place an order in the frontend, which the admin will validate in the backend.
 Login and Logout — Customers must first log in to the system before adding orders to their carts, and they can also log out once they have completed their order.
 Sign up — Before logging into the system, the consumer must first register or sign up.
Add to Cart — One of the characteristics of this system is that it allows customers to temporarily save their orders in the add to cart section.

Generally, I used the following technology:
Django framework
Python
HTML
The database is SQLite3

# Conclusion
Customers can place food orders online without of having to wait for a server to accept their order. End customers register online, read the E-menu card, and select food from the E-menu card using the application. Food can be ordered online. The chef will be able to examine the results on the screen and begin processing the food once the customer has selected the appropriate food item. This application eliminates the need for a waiter or decreases the waiter’s duty. The benefit is that there is more space in a packed restaurant will be chances that the waiters are overburdened with orders. When they’re unable to match the criteria.
